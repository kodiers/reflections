How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see, what I change in new version of file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because I have all history of my changes, and this can help me to revert to old version and to find my mistake.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: When I do commit, my code is tested and checked by me, and my colleagues can view worked code. Cons: when something goes wrong with my PC, all change will be lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was designed for programmers, when project consists with multiple files, when Google docs was designed for work with documents, like MS word document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows all commit log, git diff - show changes in last commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can see, what others developers done, and write code with regard to their change

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Create repository
